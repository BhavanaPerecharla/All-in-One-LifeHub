In the MainActivity, the code initializes UI components for username and password input, buttons for login, sign-up, and forgot password. It establishes a connection with a DatabaseHelper for user authentication. The login function validates user credentials using the database and, if successful, saves the session data using SharedPreferences. If credentials are invalid, it displays a toast message. The SignUpPage button redirects users to the registration page, while the ForgotPassword button navigates to the password recovery page. The code facilitates login management, navigation to sign-up, and password recovery.
